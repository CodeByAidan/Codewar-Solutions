<h1>What's a Perfect Power Anyway?</h1>
<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>A perfect power is a classification of positive integers:</p>

    <blockquote>In mathematics, a perfect power is a positive integer that can be expressed as an integer power of another positive integer. More formally, n is a perfect power if there exist natural numbers m > 1, and k > 1 such that mk = n.</blockquote>

<p>Your task is to check wheter a given integer is a perfect power. If it is a perfect power, return a pair m and k with mk = n as a proof. Otherwise return Nothing, Nil, null, None or your language's equivalent.</p>

<p>Note: For a perfect power, there might be several pairs. For example 81 = 3^4 = 9^2, so (3,4) and (9,2) are valid solutions. However, the tests take care of this, so if a number is a perfect power, return any pair that proves it.</p>
<p>Examples</p>

<pre>
Test.describe("perfect powers", function(){
  Test.it("should work for some examples",function(){
    Test.assertSimilar(isPP(4), [2,2], "4 = 2^2");
    Test.assertSimilar(isPP(9), [3,2], "9 = 3^2");
    Test.assertEquals( isPP(5), null, "5 isn't a perfect number");
  });
});
</pre>
